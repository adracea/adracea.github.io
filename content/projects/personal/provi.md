I, and a bunch of other people were using this piece of software while playing EVE Online around 2020. The original developer of the project had already stopped maintaning it (had archived it too) and due to various breaking changes in other services, it had stopped working. At the time I just made my own version of it and got it back in working condition with minimal future proofing. A short while afterwards I stopped playing the game due to the ProviBloc dissolving.
