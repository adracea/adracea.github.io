## Moved to my own domain

Recently started doing some tests with various applications and hosting some services for myself. While my ISP does provide me with a ddns, it's not giving me access to the records so I've decided to get my own domain at [drakkarson.com](https://drakkarson.com).

The apex is now basically just hosting my github pages website but I can now how my own services on any of the subdomains if I so decide.
